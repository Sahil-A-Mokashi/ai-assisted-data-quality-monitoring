## What This Is

An information system for a small data analytics consultancy that receives CSV datasets from clients and needs to assess their quality before using them in reporting or analytics pipelines.

Users upload a CSV dataset through the web interface. The system automatically profiles it, calculates a quality score, predicts a risk level, and stores everything for review. Datasets and their quality reports can be searched, filtered, updated, and deleted through the frontend without any page refresh.

---

## System Architecture


Frontend (HTML + Vanilla JS + Fetch API)
↓
Flask REST API (Python)
↓
SQLite Database (via SQLAlchemy)
↓
Pandas Profiling + Rule-Based Risk Engine
↓
Google Cloud Storage (CSV file storage)


No page refresh. All interactions go through REST API calls.

---

## Features

- Upload CSV datasets with metadata (name, organisation, source system, domain)
- Automatic data profiling on upload (missing values, duplicates, outliers, invalid emails, schema issues)
- Quality score calculated from profiling results
- AI-assisted risk prediction (Low / Medium / High) based on quality score
- Email address validation via external API during profiling
- Full CRUD operations on datasets and reviews
- Search by name, organisation, source system
- Filter by risk level, status, upload date
- Sort by quality score, upload date, name
- Review workflow (Approved / Rejected / Under Review)
- Quality report per dataset
- CSV files stored in Google Cloud Storage

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Fetch API |
| Backend | Python 3.11, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy |
| Database | SQLite |
| File Storage | Google Cloud Storage |
| Data Processing | Pandas |
| Email Validation | Abstract API |
| Testing | Pytest |

---

## Database Tables

- **dataset** — stores metadata for each uploaded CSV
- **quality_metrics** — stores profiling results linked to each dataset
- **review** — stores reviewer comments and status per dataset

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/datasets` | List all datasets |
| GET | `/datasets/<id>` | Get one dataset |
| POST | `/datasets` | Upload new dataset |
| PUT | `/datasets/<id>` | Update dataset |
| DELETE | `/datasets/<id>` | Delete dataset |
| POST | `/analyse` | Run profiling and risk prediction |
| GET | `/metrics/<dataset_id>` | Get quality metrics |
| GET | `/dashboard` | Dashboard summary statistics |
| GET | `/report/<dataset_id>` | Full quality report |
| GET | `/reviews/<dataset_id>` | Get reviews for a dataset |
| POST | `/reviews` | Add a review |
| PUT | `/reviews/<id>` | Update a review |

---

## Validation

The backend validates all inputs and returns appropriate HTTP status codes:

- `400` — missing required fields, wrong file type, empty file
- `404` — dataset or resource not found
- `409` — duplicate dataset name
- `500` — server error with description

---

## Running Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Sahil-A-Mokashi/data-quality-monitor
cd data-quality-monitor

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your GCP credentials and Abstract API key

# 5. Run
python app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

---

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests cover:
- CRUD operations for datasets
- Quality score calculation
- API validation (bad input returns 400)
- Full upload-to-report integration test

## Relationship to Research Methods Assignment

My Research Methods CA1 investigates machine learning-based detection of data quality anomalies in cloud data lakes. This programming assignment builds the information system that wraps that research — the frontend, REST API, database, profiling pipeline, and cloud storage that would surround an ML model in a real deployment. The ML model itself is simulated here using a rule-based risk engine, designed to be replaced with a trained model from the research project later.
